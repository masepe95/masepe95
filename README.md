🙋🏻‍♂️ Hey! My name is Marco!

✈️ I’ve always been passionate about learning and embracing diversity. 
After completing high school, I made the bold decision to move in the United States. This experience taught me how to adapt to a multicultural environment, fostering resilience and an open-minded outlook. 

👔 After two years, I moved back in my hometown, starting my own entrepreneurial project.
I believe that diversity fuels innovation, and I'm excited to bring my unique perspective to any team or organization. 

👨🏻‍💻 During my childhood, I always had a huge passion for technology; I remember myself during teenage years building websites with CMS, so I decided to give life to that passion by giving continuity to my studies in web developing with Boolean. I found front end developing very inspiring! I’m ready to embrace this new career willing to learn everyday something new, and contribute to success of my next team.

🌎 I am actively seeking opportunities to connect with experienced professionals, mentors, and potential employers who share my passion for web development. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to connect with you and learn from your experiences in this exciting industry.

🗣️ If you have any insights, advice, or opportunities that you think would be valuable for someone like me who is starting their journey in web development, I would be thrilled to hear from you. Let's connect and explore the possibilities of working together or simply sharing our knowledge and experiences.
